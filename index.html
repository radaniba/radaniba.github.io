                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>MAESTRO was developed by a team of life science researchers, AI specialists, and software engineers with firsthand experience of the challenges facing modern research organizations. Our founding team includes Ph.D. scientists who spent years managing clinical trials, regulatory submissions, and quality systems before embarking on a mission to create the platform they wished they had.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is to accelerate scientific discovery by eliminating administrative burdens and providing researchers with the tools they need to focus on innovation rather than paperwork. We believe that every hour saved on documentation and administrative tasks is an hour that can be reinvested in scientific discovery and development of life-changing treatments.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the future of life science research will be increasingly driven by AI-powered tools that can handle routine tasks, identify patterns in complex data, and support human creativity and insight. MAESTRO represents our vision of this future - a comprehensive platform where advanced technology seamlessly integrates with human expertise to drive unprecedented efficiency and breakthrough discoveries.</p>
                    <p>Since our founding in 2020, MAESTRO has been deployed in over 50 research organizations globally, supporting more than 200 clinical trials and helping bring 12 new treatments to market faster than would have been possible with traditional approaches. Our team continues to expand, bringing together diverse expertise united by the common goal of transforming how life science research is conducted.</p>
